        3. About Me: I am forty one. I have been married for seventeen years.
        There are three children in my family. For the past twelve years, I have
        been the head of my micro-company in sales. Now, I am as motivated as
        possible to get an up-to-date profession. I don't have the best learning
        skills, but I will try to compensate it with diligence. My previous
        activity has formed the basic principles for doing any job: Check again.
        Do everything on time. Don't promise what I can't do.
